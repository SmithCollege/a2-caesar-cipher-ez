## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
I liked how satisfying it was to run a test and have it work. It was also kind of fun to write in secret codes. 

What was most challenging about this assignment?
I was confused as to how gradle worked (I thought the first step was getting the program to build, but you need everything to run without exceptions and pass all the tests first before you could do that so I was confused.) Also I had a hard time on the decode method because it was confusing to think backwards and inverse everything I did for encode. 

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
I feel like I understand the reason for stubs and unit testing a lot better now. I feel like there could've been a more efficient way to do it rather than making an array and then turning the array into a dynamic array but that's what I did.
